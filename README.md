Project Title : PlaceMate- Placement Analysis and Prediction System

Project Description:

PlaceMate is a comprehensive, full-stack web solution designed to bridge the gap between academic preparation and industry recruitment requirements. By leveraging historical placement trends and machine learning, the platform acts as a continuous career readiness navigator, guiding students from their freshman year through to final-year placements.

🚀 Project Overview

In the competitive landscape of higher education, institutional success is often measured by student employability. PlaceMate provides actionable, year-specific insights to students, educators, and recruiters by analyzing academic records and technical skills to predict future employment outcomes.

✨ Key Features

Continuous Career Navigator: Provides a year-by-year roadmap for students to track their progress from the start of college.

Predictive Analytics: Employs Machine Learning models to classify placement likelihood and forecast potential salary packages.

AI Resume Parsing: Integrates the Affinda API to automatically parse student resumes and identify professional strengths.

Skill Recommendations: Offers automated suggestions to help students bridge employability gaps and improve their professional profiles.

Institutional Dashboard: Enables placement cells to visualize historical recruitment trends and strategize training programs based on data-driven insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js with Material-UI for a responsive and intuitive user interface.

Backend: Flask (Python) serving RESTful APIs.

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Classification and Regression models).

Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Deployment: Containerized with Docker and deployed on Red Hat OpenShift.

📊 Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed historical student records and GDP trends to find correlations between grades and recruitment rates.

Predictive Modeling: Developed and validated Scikit-learn models to automate placement and salary forecasting.

System Integration: Developed a decoupled architecture where the React frontend communicates with the Flask-based ML engine.
